**PAWAN SHAKTI**: An Advanced Low-Speed Wind Energy System
This project report details the development and analysis of PAWAN SHAKTI, a robust wind energy system engineered to overcome the limitations of conventional wind power generation in low-wind environments. By targeting a specific operational range of 

2-8 m/s , this system leverages an innovative design to provide a continuous, sustainable, and reliable power source for rural and off-grid applications.



**System Architecture and Specifications**
The system is built around a highly efficient mechanical-to-electrical conversion chain. The propeller, crafted from 

ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) for durability, captures kinetic energy from low-speed winds. This rotational energy is then transmitted to a 



planetary gear system with a 1:10 ratio. This gearbox, constructed from ABS and coated with aluminum, significantly increases the shaft's rotational speed, which is crucial for maximizing the output of the subsequent generator.





The core of the system is a 

100-watt DC generator. This generator, rated at 




24 volts and a maximum current of 4.16 amps, converts the mechanical energy into electrical energy with an impressive efficiency of 80-85%. The generated power can be directly supplied to DC loads with a rating of less than 100W or stored in a 



1 kW battery pack. The battery system is managed by a 


**BMS (Battery Management System)** to ensure optimal charging and longevity.

**Engineering Design and Analysis**
The design process for PAWAN SHAKTI was a multi-stage, iterative engineering effort. 

Fusion 360 was used to create precise 3D models of the propeller blades, focusing on optimizing their aerodynamic profiles. The designs were then subjected to rigorous 

ANSYS simulations to assess performance, material stress, and overall structural integrity. This simulation-driven approach allowed for the refinement of blade angles and materials to achieve maximum thrust and minimal drag, ultimately leading to a more efficient final design. The integration and simulation of the planetary gear system were also critical in ensuring synchronized and efficient operation.




**Performance Metrics and Comparative Analysis**
A key advantage of the PAWAN SHAKTI system is its superior performance compared to a 100-watt solar energy setup. The project report highlights several critical metrics:


**Efficiency**: The wind energy system boasts an efficiency of up to 35%, whereas solar energy has a maximum efficiency of 18%.


**Operation Time**: The system provides power continuously, operating 24 hours a day, a significant advantage over solar, which is limited to 5-8 hours of operation.



**Maintenance Cost**: Wind energy has a lower maintenance cost, ranging from 2,000-5,000 Rs, while solar maintenance can range from 4,000-9,000 Rs.


**Recovery Time*: The capital recovery time for the wind system is approximately 7-8 years, faster than the approximate 10 years for a solar energy system.

**Diverse Applications**
The system's low-power output and continuous operation make it ideal for a variety of applications beyond rural household use:


**Monitoring Systems**: It can power over 2,500 weather and 200 radiation monitoring systems that require 50-100 watts of power.


**Communication**: The system can operate Wi-Fi routers and chargers in homes.


**Infrastructure:** It is a viable power source for base transceiver stations, which operate on a 50-300 watt power scale.


**Emerging Technologies:** The system is also suitable for surveillance, smart home applications, and agricultural monitoring systems.
